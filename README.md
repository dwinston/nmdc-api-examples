# nmdc-client-api

This is a sandbox repo for prototyping ideas for an [NMDC](https://microbiomedata.org/) client (end-user / data-consumer) API.

This API is not to be confused with the [nmdc-runtime](https://github.com/microbiomedata/nmdc-runtime) API, for which the intended audience is data producers and stewards.
